I am 1st-year PhD student at [Spoken Language Processing Laboratory (Kitaoka Lab)](https://slp.cs.tut.ac.jp/), [Toyohashi Unversity of Technology](https://www.tut.ac.jp/english/), under the supervision of Prof. [Norihide Kitaoka](https://sites.google.com/site/norihidekitaokashome/).  
I am interested in speech recognition and natural language processing.  
I am looking for visiting student and internship opportunities.
